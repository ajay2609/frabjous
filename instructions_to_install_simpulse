Now follow the Readme:
Install Cython if your system does not have it and fftw3 also.Both can be installed in linix using 
pip install cython 
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev

Add PYTHONPATH to your environment. if you are installing in the virtual environmetn. note the path you are providing in the 
Makefile.local which you need to create in the top level simpulse directory. if you are in ubuntu use Makefile.local.orangutan

Especially if your are installing in the virtual environment.
add this line to ~/.bashrc so that these paths are initialised everytime terminal is opened.
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH= path to your python files diestory
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $LD_LIBRARY_PATH = library diectory path in your system
